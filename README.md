# Orbital-Components

Given the state vector of an orbit, this program will return the following orbital parameters:

- Current distance from the focus (r)
- Magnitude of the current velocity (v)
- Magnitude of the current radial velocity (v_rad)
- Magnitude of the current tangential velocity (v_tan)
- Current flight path angle (gam)
- The angular momentum vector (H)
- Magnitude of the angular momentum vector (h)
- The inclination of the orbit (i)
- The vector of the ascending node (N)
- Magnitude of the ascending node (n)
- Right ascension of the ascending node (O)
- The eccentricity vector (e)
- The eccentricity of the orbit (e_abs)
- Argument of perigee for the orbit (w)
- Current true anomaly of the craft (theta)
- Distance at perigee (r_p)
- Distance at apogee (r_a)
- Semi-major axis of the orbit (a)
- Semi-minor axis of the orbit (b)
- Period of the orbit, in seconds (T)
